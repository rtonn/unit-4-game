### Crystal Collector Game

#About:
* This is a front-end application the uses HTML5, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery. This project uses jQuery to dynamically update the HTML of the application.
* The page was built using Bootstrap for responsiveness.


#The Game:
* There will be four gems displayed as buttons at the top of the page. 
* The player will be shown a random number at the start of the game as their "Goal" count. 
* When the player clicks on a gem it will add a specific amount of points to the player's total score.
* The player wins the game if their total score matches the random "goal" number and the player loses the game if their total score goes above the goal number.* 
* The number of games won and lost will be displayed.
* If the player successfully matches their total score to the random number they get 1 win, if the player's total score is above the random number the player get 1 loss, either way the game restarts.
* When the game is restarted, the player will be shown a new random number, all the gems will now have 4 different hidden values, and the player's total score is reset to 0.


# Game design note:
* The random number shown at the start of the game should be between 19 - 120
* Each gem should have a random hidden value between 1 - 12
